Description: Implementation of the Interval Testing Procedure for functional data in different frameworks (i.e., one or two-population frameworks, functional linear models) by means of different basis expansions (i.e., B-spline, Fourier, and phase-amplitude Fourier). The current version of the package requires functional data evaluated on a uniform grid; it automatically projects each function on a chosen functional basis; it performs the entire family of multivariate tests; and, finally, it provides the matrix of the p-values of the previous tests and the vector of the corrected p-values. The functional basis, the coupled or uncoupled scenario, and the kind of test can be chosen by the user. The package provides also a plotting function creating a graphical output of the procedure: the p-value heat-map, the plot of the corrected p-values, and the plot of the functional data.
